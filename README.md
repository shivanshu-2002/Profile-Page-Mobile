The ProfileComponent is a React component designed to display user profile information. It leverages the DataContext for managing and retrieving user data, rendering a dynamic and visually appealing profile interface.

Installation
To use the ProfileComponent in your React application, follow these steps:

Import the ProfileComponent into your file:

javascript
Copy code
import ProfileComponent from '<path-to-profile-component>/ProfileComponent';
Make sure to have the required dependencies installed. This component depends on:

React (ensure it's installed in your project)
Icons: react-icons library (specifically FaRegUser, SlCalender, LuContact, MdOutlineMail, FaRegAddressCard, MdOutlineBusinessCenter)
A Spinner component (ensure it's available in your project)
Ensure that you have a DataContext provider wrapping the component or provide the necessary context for currUser, handleNext, and handlePrev to be available.

Usage
Once imported, you can use the ProfileComponent in your React application:

javascript
Copy code
import React from 'react';
import { DataContextProvider } from '<path-to-data-context>/DataContextProvider';
import ProfileComponent from '<path-to-profile-component>/ProfileComponent';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <DataContextProvider>
      {/* Other components */}
      <ProfileComponent />
      {/* Other components */}
    </DataContextProvider>
  );
};

export default App;
Ensure that the DataContextProvider wraps the component or that the necessary context is provided.

Props
The ProfileComponent does not accept any props. It relies on the data provided by the DataContext and the functions handleNext and handlePrev for navigation.

Styling
The component uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling. You may customize these styles based on your project's design requirements.
